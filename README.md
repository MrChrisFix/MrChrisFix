<h3> Hello! :wave: </h3>
Welcome to my Github page! Who am I? I’m Christian aka @MrChrisFix. Right now I'm just a student studying computer science at the Silesian University of Technology (Poland). <br>

<h3>Programming languages :clipboard:</h3>
My main programming language is C++, but I also know C and Assembly.<br>
I have also some experience with Java (I hate it though) <br>
My first programming language I've learned was Python, but now I only know the basics of the basics of the syntax.

<h3> My interests :fire:</h3>
I’m interested in physics, astronomy, math, programming and video games. <br>

<h3>Quote</h3>

```cpp
for(int i = 6; i != 5; i++)
  if(i == 0) std::cout<<"Done\n";
//It's not about the destination  
//It's about the journey
```
